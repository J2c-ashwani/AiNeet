Summary: The "Biotechnology And Its Applications" chapter contributed a total of 25
questions, showing its consistent importance in NEET exams. Questions are predominantly of
Medium difficulty (13 questions), with a good number of Easy (9 questions) and some Hard (3
questions).
Insights:
• Biotechnological Applications in Medicine, particularly Recombinant Insulin
(Humulin) and Gene Therapy, are frequently tested, spanning Easy to Medium difficulty.
• Applications in Agriculture, such as Bt Cotton and RNA Interference, are also
consistently important, often with Medium difficulty.
• Molecular Diagnosis is a recurring topic with a mix of difficulty.
• General introductions to biotechnological applications and the concept of Green
Revolution appear periodically.

Summary: The "Evolution" chapter is a moderate contributor, with a total of 19 questions
across the six years. Questions are largely balanced between Easy (8 questions) and Medium (9
questions), with a couple of Hard questions (2 questions).
Insights:
• Evidences for Evolution (Embryological, Biogeographical, Morphological) are
frequently tested, spanning Easy to Medium difficulty.
• Concepts like Convergent and Divergent Evolution and Adaptive Radiation are
consistently important, often appearing as Medium questions.
• Hardy-Weinberg Principle and Natural Selection are also recurring topics, with a mix
of Easy and Hard questions.
• Theor ies of Origin of Life (Oparin-Haldane) and the Origin and Evolution of Man are
periodically examined.
• A Brief Account of Evolution, specifically animal forms through geological periods, can
be a Hard question.
